# Signal Analysis
## But what does it even mean?

This repository contains of notebooks I made to analyse signals registered during various electro- medical examinations (eg. EKG, EMG, EOG, EEG). Each notebook is a solution to specific examination method related task on 2nd year Bioelectrical Signals class (Biomedical Physics, Neuroinformatics, Physics Department, University of Warsaw).
